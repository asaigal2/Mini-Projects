# Mini-Projects
I am doing 15 days of ML Mini Projects:

**Project 1**: Wine Quality Classification
The dataset was obtained online from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes approximately 5000 variations of white wine, with features such as citric acid levels, pH, alcohol, acidity, density, and more. The dataset also includes a quality measure ranging from 0 to 10.The data was cleaned using Python to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for modeling.

Modeling: The cleaned data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Four different classifiers were used to predict wine quality:

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
